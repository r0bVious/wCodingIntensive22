                    You dive under and start swimming toward the edge of the pool. As you break the surface, water streaks down your face.
                    You reach up onto the deck, wet hair covering your eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You touch something metallic and vibrating. A strange energy begins to pulse through you and into the water as you try
                    to clear the water and hair from your eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A loud hum begins to fill your ears. You can't get your grip away from the device. You have to let go. Now.
