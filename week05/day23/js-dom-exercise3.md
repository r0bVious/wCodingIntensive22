1. Using only JS, generate the necessary HTML to re-create the text in the image: ![html to reproduce](./js-dom-exercise3-1.png)

   The text includes parts in bold and parts that are anchor links to remote websites. The "standards organization" text should link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards_organization and the "World Wide Web" text should link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium on your finished result.

   ```

   ![list to reproduce](./js-dom-exercise3-2.png)

1. Create an HTML file uploading section using only JS that will appear like the following image:
