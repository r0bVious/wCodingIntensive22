                    You get your awesome new Speedo on and head outside. Your weirdo little sister left all her sciency
                    junk out on the deck again. What a nerd. You navigate her maze of gizmos and gadgets and dive into the pool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aw yeah, that's it.
                </p>

                    You relax for what feels like hours. Your stomach rumbles. Your mom and sister will be home soon - it'll be dinner time.
                    Should you try to fit a snack in before the get here?
                </p>
