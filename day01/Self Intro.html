        <p>I'm a retired professional ballerino/hopscotch player. I like spicy food, good times, and The Frog (as seen on Wikipedia). Jokes aside, I'm a 36 year old American that has lived and worked in Korea (mostly teaching English) since 2012. I'm married with a daughter. Hi.</p>

                            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_leaves"><b>House of Leaves</b></a></p>
                            <p><i>House of Leaves is not an enjoyable book to read in many ways. 
                                It's disjointed and at times outright confusing. 
                                The book itself features the maze-like conditions that various characters experience in their own stories 
                                - text is cut-off, upside down, or sometimes covered by other text or scans of images. 
                                It's a confounding read, but it is one of few books truly able to elicit the dread of being lost within something.
